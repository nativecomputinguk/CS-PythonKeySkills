** Learn It - for loops and while loops

 + The purpose of loops is to repeat a set of commands or a block of code
*** for loops
+ for loops are normally used to repeat a set of commands for a specific known number of times.
#+BEGIN_SRC Python

for i in range(5):
    print("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC
+ the above code will print out "Hello world!" 5 times with i starting from 0, increasing each loop by 1, up to 4.
+ the range is a Python built-in function that produce a series of numbers.

*** while loops
+ while loops are normally used to repeat a set of commands until certain condition(s) are no longer true.
+ Example while loop 1:
#+BEGIN_SRC Python
i=0
while i < 5:
    print("Hello world!")
    i = i + 1
#+END_SRC

+ Example while loop 2:
#+BEGIN_SRC Python
hungry = True
while hungry:
    print("I need eat more.")
    answer = input("Are you still hungry?(Y/N)")
    if answer == "N":
       hungry = False
#+END_SRC

+ The above loop will end if the user input "N", which changes the hungry variable to "False".  This means, the condition is not true anymore.
